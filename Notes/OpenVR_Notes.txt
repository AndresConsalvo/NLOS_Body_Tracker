3 different devices means that you will have 3 different .cpp class files inheriting from ITrackedDeviceServerDriver that will implement the class functions differently
    - The class being inherited from comes from openvr_driver.h

DeviceProvider.cpp initializes instances of the classes; essentially loops through all devices initialized every frame.

DeviceFactory.cpp returns an instance of the class defined in DeviceProvider.cpp, which is called every frame. Allows OpenVR to be updated with input
from the controller.

Essentailly, a class for the device just talks to the device, DeviceProvider manages these classes, and then the DeviceFactory returns an instance of the DeviceProvider
to OpenVR.
