1/7/2022
- Searched for alternative IMUs as the BMX160 is out of stock and has long lead times.

1/11/2022
- Alternative components found and ordered.
    - Voltage regulator changed
    - BMS changed
    - Port changed from micro-USB to USB-C
    - IMU swapped from BMX160 to MPU
- Modified original schematic to reflect swapped out components.    

1/12/2022
- Updated schematic components to ECAD (used to be custom-made blocks that were used as placeholders)
- Updated schematic to needed resistor and capacitor values
- Started researching filter implementations to correct gyroscope noise

1/13/2022
- Updated schematic; replaced battery placeholder and renamed port labels
- Researched gyroscope data filtering 
    - Looked at "Optimization approach to adapt Kalman filters for the real-time application of accelerometer and gyroscope signalsâ€™ filtering" by Cezary Kownacki
- Started work on PCB design

1/16/2022
- Replaced pushbutton switch Jaxson added as the footprint for the switch had an error.
- Updated PCB design with new components Jaxson added, worked on routing and circuit board shape.

1/17/2022
- Replaced button again for a cheaper version
- Began routing new components in PCB schematic that Jaxson added

1/19/2022
- Added routes between all components on the PCB.
- Began verifying and correcting PCB design
- Had to revert changes due to a github repository mistake.

1/20/2022
- Began researching and taking notes on the OpenVR API and how to communicate with it
