Ruo Log:

1/7/2022
- Searched for alternative IMUs as the BMX160 is out of stock and has long lead times.

1/11/2022
- Alternative components found and ordered.
    - Voltage regulator changed
    - BMS changed
    - Port changed from micro-USB to USB-C
    - IMU swapped from BMX160 to MPU
- Modified original schematic to reflect swapped out components.

1/12/2022
- Updated schematic components to ECAD (used to be custom-made blocks that were used as placeholders)
- Updated schematic to needed resistor and capacitor values
- Started researching filter implementations to correct gyroscope noise

1/13/2022
- Researched gyroscope data filtering 
    - Looked at "Optimization approach to adapt Kalman filters for the real-time application of accelerometer and gyroscope signalsâ€™ filtering" by Cezary Kownacki
- Started work on PCB design
