2/8/22
  - Testing 3D design with loop strap fit and adjustable strap buckle (cinch)
    - hook and loop straps not giving enough when thigh muscles contract, making some pisitions difficult
      - may need a method to stetch a small amount. Possibly hide a rubber band to stretch apart two pieces. 
  - Got group together to do a dry run of the presentation. First take went bad, so we adjusted and tried again, practicing through Zoom.
2/7/22

    Todo: embed an easy snap fit or slide together
  - Worked on presentation slides and had team read over
2/6/22
  - Began printing 3D models to test for structural integrity, battery fit, and hook and loop strap fit
    - needed to make strap slot larger
    - needed smaller battery compartment, batteries were smaller on all sides, but correct thickness
    - adjusted battery wire holes and allowed more space for USB-C and switch
    - Added sight blockers to conform around open ports of case covers
2/5/22
  - Working on 3d case models
    - adjusted spacing of ports and size of trackers

2/3/22
  - Working on Beta Build docs. Set new expectations for tests based on Alpha Build testing.
  - Found backup plan for hardware in the event PCBs do not come in. Use SMD to DIP proto boards to test parts on breadboard and program MCU.
  - Consulted Andres regarding specifics to testing refinement.
  - Spruced up cases for hardware Beta Build portions.
2/2/22
  - Meeting with Joe, assigned him the task and gave insight on schematic to understand the requirements.
  - Emails with Blanchard and communications through Evan concerning unable to deliver on upcoming milestones
    
    Current asks:
    - Keep a log of all communications with Evan in check-ins and CC stakeholder on important notes
    1) complete everything that can be done without the PCB(s) by Friday.
    2) Keep Evan informed of *all* updates to the situation. As soon as you receive it, let him know.
    3) Plan to immediately assemble hardware and complete any remaining tests for the beta as soon as the PCB(s) arrive.
    4) construct a brief but complete report on any remaining tests that were completed, and email to Evan / CC myself and Carsten.

1/27/22
  - Introduced Joe to the group and gave a rundown of the project.
1/26/22
  - Spoke with Evan regarding the status of the project and gave demos of the software side.
  - Looked into PCB manufacturers to hopefully get ordered, but also need to ensure all parts arrive in case design needs to be changed.
  - Reached out to Joseph Gross to extend invite to group Discord
1/25/22
  - Finished creating last parts list, replaced MOSFET that went OOS and immediately ordered parts.
  - Updated schematic with all new parts with Ruo
  - Messaged with Blanchard on the additional team member.
1/24/22
  - Added battery voltage metering circuit using the ESP32's ADC. Also added an LED indicator for the device On/Disconnected/Off states.
  - Worked with Andres to test the build on a fresh install of dependencies
  - Replaced transistors with higher rated SML-E12P8WT86, found that may need a different LDO voltage regulator due to minimum requirements listed on ESP32.
  - Merged software branches to main and submitted Alpha Build.
1/22/22
  - Worked on modifying casings to meet size requirements of PCB.
1/21/22
  - Worked with team to finish Alpha test plan.
  - Observed testing of the GUI application.
  - Made descision to submit all Alpha documents this night and then resubmit Alpha Build on Monday due to production build bugs.
1/20/22
  - Checked in with Carsten over Teams to talk about design again. No obvious issues. Recommended to add test pads, an option to bypass the MOSFET, and silkscreens
  - Considered adding another transistor to prevent possible current flow across the zener diode, Z1, when charging.
  - Finalized circuit analytics with data from datasheets to ensure proper functions
  - Spoke with all team members on plans for the 21st (happy bday to me) to finish the alpha build.
  - Ran by the schematic to Fariha to get one last opinion. Will be replacing resistors with smaller values and will NOT add second MOSFET
  - Checked over electrical characteristics for voltage regulator to ensure all parts were within the normal outputs of the battery/USB-C.
1/19/22
  - Replaced generic parts with sourced parts on Digikey (resistors, capacitors, MOSFETs)
1/18/22
  - Spoke with Carsten about the battery management section of the PCB and got a reference schematic that could help.
  - Began reviewing other implementations of battery protection
1/17/22
  - Realized battery protection circuit uses a BJT instead of a MOSFET after looking for parts on Digikey over the weekend
  - Added power source switching functionality with Schottky diodes after research
  - Began replacing generic parts.
1/14/22
  - Worked with Ruo in deciding to use a simple circuit or IC for battery protection
  - Reviewed the battery manager datasheet to ensure reverse current was not possible
  - Discussed with Ruo on options for switching between power sources
  - Added to PCB schematic with deep discharge protection circuit
  - Reviewed MOSFETs to switch between power sources
  - Found out that the ESP32 has an ADC that we could use to track battery charge as an option for the GUI

    - decided on LDO voltage regulator over Switching regulator due to power consumption (Iq) and simplicity
