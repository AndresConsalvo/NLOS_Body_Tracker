  - Checked in with Carsten over Teams to talk about design again. No obvious issues. Recommended to add test pads, an option to bypass the MOSFET, and silkscreens
  - Considered adding another transistor to prevent possible current flow across the zener diode, Z1, when charging.
  - Finalized circuit analytics with data from datasheets to ensure proper functions
  - Spoke with all team members on plans for the 21st (happy bday to me) to finish the alpha build.
  - Ran by the schematic to Fariha to get one last opinion. Will be replacing resistors with smaller values and will NOT add second MOSFET
  - Checked over electrical characteristics for voltage regulator to ensure all parts were within the normal outputs of the battery/USB-C.
1/19/21
  - Replaced generic parts with sourced parts on Digikey (resistors, capacitors, MOSFETs)
1/18/22
  - Spoke with Carsten about the battery management section of the PCB and got a reference schematic that could help.
  - Began reviewing other implementations of battery protection
1/17/22
  - Realized battery protection circuit uses a BJT instead of a MOSFET after looking for parts on Digikey over the weekend
  - Added power source switching functionality with Schottky diodes after research
  - Began replacing generic parts.
1/14/22
  - Worked with Ruo in deciding to use a simple circuit or IC for battery protection
  - Reviewed the battery manager datasheet to ensure reverse current was not possible
  - Discussed with Ruo on options for switching between power sources
  - Added to PCB schematic with deep discharge protection circuit
  - Reviewed MOSFETs to switch between power sources
  - Found out that the ESP32 has an ADC that we could use to track battery charge as an option for the GUI
1/13/22 - 3hrs
  - Worked with Ruo on part selection and finalizing schematic for PCB creation.
  - Changed schematic switches to PCM12SMTR and FSM1LP
  - Adding diode to schematic to prevent power consumption below 3.0V of battery
1/12/22 - 2.5hrs
  - Gave Ruo part data to build part designs easier in Altium
  - Verified Ruo's implementations of devices with documentation available.
  - Researched compatibility for parts and current/voltage protection
  - Revised Gantt chart for PCB and casing creation
1/11/22 - 4hrs
  - Worked with Ruo in lab to find alternative components
    - Voltage regulator changed on schematic
    - BMS changed on schematic
    - Port changed from micro-USB to USB-C on schematic
    - IMU swapped from BMX160 to MPU on schematic
  - Researched battery charging DOs and DONTs
    - cannot use temperature sensor on Bat Manager since battery in a different case
    - decided on LDO voltage regulator over Switching regulator due to power consumption (Iq) and simplicity
    - need a diode to prevent battery drainage past 3.0V as it could irreparably hurt the battery.
1/10/22 - 1hr
  - Researching parts to order on mouser
    - Batteries, USB to UART, Battery Manager, USB connector Type C
  - Researched JST connectors to get the appropriate size and quality
1/9/22 - 2hrs
  - Revised Gantt chart to include alpha and beta build sprints, adjusted other timelines accordingly
  - Held group meeting to hand out tasks and cover the new gantt chart
  - Ordered IMU and WiFi/microcontroller modules to prevent stock issues
1/7/22 - 2hrs
  - Worked with Ruo to find a replacement IMU since the BMX160 went out of stock, replaced with 6-axis MPU-6881.
