2/24/22
  - Found out that removing and shorting R7 and the MOSFET gave the 3.3V we needed, but every 100ms was a drop in voltage.
  - Ruo dropped off new ESP32 board, went to work on desoldering all the pins
2/23/22
  - Worked with Carsten in diagnosing the voltage issue. He suggested R7 as we are running through with the voltage supplier
  - Worked on desoldering battery management to get better voltages to LDO.
2/22/22
  - Tested CP2102 with soldered VREGIN, but no luck in getting COM port open.
  - Head to lab to meet Ruo and Joe.
  - No progress on ESP8266 programming, SPI still had issues with arduino
  - Ruo suggested getting new boards but ESP32s instead
    - discussed with Ruo on replacement wifi modules
2/21/22
  - USBCs arrived and soldered. Charge LED shines and battery management work.
  - USB to UART does not work.
  - Voltage issues going to LDO.
  - Tried to help Joe with ESP8266 issues in SPI
  - Ruo ordered more dev boards and breakout boards for ESP, IMU, and USB to UART
  - Dropped off 2 PCBs to Ruo and 1 to Joe
  - Reviewed docs for CP2102 and found that we were missing a VDD or VREGIN connection to 3.3V or VDD
    - solution is to attach VREGIN to nearby via w/ 5V.
2/20/22
  - Stayed in discord for group members to join and update (Andres and Fariha were not available)
  - Tried to get Joe set up with th IMU data retrieval by sending appropriate docs

    - worked with Ruo to immediately find a replacement. The 1054500101 seemed to be OOS everywhere or long lead times.
    - Ruo checked ECE groups at UF for the part, since he pulled it from their library.
  - Tried to put solder on all the pads. It was really difficult, needed liquid flux badly to continue.
2/11/22

      - may need a method to stetch a small amount. Possibly hide a rubber band to stretch apart two pieces. 
  - Got group together to do a dry run of the presentation. First take went bad, so we adjusted and tried again, practicing through Zoom.
2/7/22
  - 3D modeling, attempting to print all case parts for a set fit
    Todo: embed an easy snap fit or slide together

  - Spruced up cases for hardware Beta Build portions.
2/2/22
  - Meeting with Joe, assigned him the task and gave insight on schematic to understand the requirements.

    Current asks:
    - Keep a log of all communications with Evan in check-ins and CC stakeholder on important notes
    1) complete everything that can be done without the PCB(s) by Friday.
    2) Keep Evan informed of *all* updates to the situation. As soon as you receive it, let him know.
    3) Plan to immediately assemble hardware and complete any remaining tests for the beta as soon as the PCB(s) arrive.
    4) construct a brief but complete report on any remaining tests that were completed, and email to Evan / CC myself and Carsten.
